Iâ€™m Kristian Bodeholt a Danish Security Professional that are trying to combat imposter syndrome by writing this Security oriented blog. Since I have an educational background within networking infrastructure and IT project management will try to balance my writings between technical and more Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) related topics.
