Iâ€™m Kristian Bodeholt a Danish Security Professional that are trying to combat imposter syndrome by writing this Security oriented blog. Since I have an educational background within networking infrastructure and IT project management will try to balance my writings between technical and more Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) related topics.    

**Disclaimer:** This is a personal blog. Any views or opinions represented in this blog are personal and do not represent the organizations that I may or may not be associated with in professional or personal capacity, unless explicitly stated.
