Iâ€™m Kristian Bodeholt a Danish Security Professional that are trying to combat imposter syndrome by writing this Security oriented blog. Since I have an educational background within IT networking infrastructure and IT project management, will I try to balance my writings between technical and more Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) related topics.

# Mentoring, Examination & Community Events    
To contribute to the InfoSec community, I try to help new aspiring talents by providing free mentoring. I also volunteer as an external examiner spanning from VET programs to AP degrees and have participated in examination of more than a hundred students. My latest contribution is trying to help organize InfoSec community events as I am one of the founding members of [BSides Aarhus Association](https://bsidesaar.dk/) that will hopefully host its first event in [2020](https://2020.bsidesaar.dk/).
