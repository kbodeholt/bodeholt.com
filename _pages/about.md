Iâ€™m a Danish Security Professional that are trying to combat imposter syndrome by writing this Security oriented blog. Since I have an educational background within IT networking infrastructure and IT project management, will I try to balance my writings between technical and more Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) related topics.

# Mentoring & Community    
To contribute to the InfoSec community, I try to help new aspiring talents by providing free mentoring. I also volunteer as an external examiner spanning from VET programs to AP degrees and have participated in examination of more than a hundred students. My latest contribution is trying to help organize InfoSec community events as I am one of the founding members of the [BSides Aarhus Association](https://bsidesaar.dk/) and founder of the [VSec Infosec Community](https://vsec.dk). If you want to donate to me directly for the non-profit work that I do you can buy me a cup of coffee [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kbodeholt) or send a donation to [Coding Pirates](https://codingpirates.dk/stoet-os/) on my behalf.
